  - add Gentoo::Portage::Q module and migrate to it for get env vars, get repos, etc
    so should fix Gentoo bug #581490 and github #26

  - introduce App::gcpan and start slowly moving code from g-cpan to there

  - rework Makefile.PL a little
    - keep non-core & core deps separatly
    - place test reqs under proper section

  - migrate to 'Changes' (CPAN-like) instead of 'ChangeLog'
    but keep 'ChangeLog' anyway to save history
